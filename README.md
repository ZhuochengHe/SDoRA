# DoRA-SoRA-and-LoRA
Testing DoRA, SoRA and LoRA on different datasets.
This repository integrates the following projects:

- [LoRA (by Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA)
- [SoRA (by Tsinghua C3I)](https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/SoRA)
- [DoRA (by NVLabs)](https://github.com/NVlabs/DoRA)

We reimplement the algorithms of LoRA, SoRA and DoRA. We also integrate SoRA and DoRA as SDoRA, which is composed of sparse gating and weight decomposition.
